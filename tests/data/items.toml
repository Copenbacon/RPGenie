#       - chest: chest slot
#       - legs: legs slot
#       - item: cannot be worn; eg. healing items, key items etc.
#
# If the item can be worn, a few optional attributes are available:
# atk: attack damage increase (type: int)
# def: defence increase       (type: int)
# specialAttack: you can define a function in your code and
#                add its name as an argument to this (type: str)
# combine: list of items that, when combined to this item, will produce a new item

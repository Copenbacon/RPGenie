# Define game objects, such as sprites, here
# I propose a syntax like this:
#
# [{object family}]
#
# [{object family}.{object ID}]
#
# And for situational animations/sprites:
# [{object family}.{object ID}.{animation}]
#
# name: object's name, used for debugging or even in-game
# idle_animation: array of object's idle/base animation frames
